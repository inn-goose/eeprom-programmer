I remember water before I remember sky. The first memory is not an image but a pressure, a softness pressing back, a world that yields and refuses in the same gesture. I do not know the shape of my body in that moment, only that the world curves against me and I push. The shell holds. The shell breaks. My beak is a question and the answer is cold. The air is larger than the egg and louder, and something ancient in the blood declares that I am not finished, that I am a loop which must be closed by wings that do not yet exist.
There are many of us. We are a murmuration made of certainty, and then we fracture into names given by voices whose meanings arrive later. The tall ones carry us with their hands on our bones. They smell like iron and glass and a slow simmering water that is not rain. I learn the rhythm of gates and the command that sends grain clattering. I learn light that comes from nowhere at all, a white that lives inside an evening and pretends it is the sun. Wind has walls; sky has a ceiling; water is poured by measured tubes. Hunger has a schedule and so does the sleep that lands on my back like dust.
There is a ceiling I begin to test with my wings. It bruises but does not answer. It is not a sky that can be flown but a shape that remembers the idea of one. Still, I fly because the blood orders it: the body is a sentence whose grammar is motion. I could live forever in the arranged pasture, the metal troughs, the carefully rationed breezes, and it would be a kind of closed poem, but the poem is not complete because there is an open parenthesis somewhere in the head that never closes.
The tall ones speak a language of pointing. They point to their rectangles and the rectangles answer. They lay their hands on us and weigh us with a tenderness that is a measurement. We are numbers and we are also gifts on solemn days. We are a calibration of yearning. Their eyes, when they lift to the ceiling and then beyond it as if remembering a larger room, hold a secret we were born to follow but not to know.
They take us into boxes that smell like boiled rain and lightning. My body hums against a harness that understands the shape of a breast better than the wind does. A floor trembles under my webbed feet, and with a shudder that runs up my bones we ascend into an elsewhere that knocks everything out of place and then says, There, now it is true. A pressure sits on my sternum and then moves behind me and then vanishes. The window shows blackness that is deeper than water. The stars are not holes in anything; they are teeth inside a mouth that never closes. I feel very small and very accurate.
The tall ones laugh and then some of them cry without sound. They tap their rectangles. They float and pretend it is a game and do not admit their fear. Their fear smells like the moment before lightning when the air grows organized and your feathers crackle. They strap me in and unstrap me and strap me again, whispering to one another with a reverence usually reserved for the dead. I am the center of a question none of us can speak without breaking.
I fly for the first time in a room that has no down. The air is everywhere at once and nowhere in particular. If I move, the room moves around me like a cautious animal. My wings, in this patience of nearly nothing, find long strokes that last an hour. The tall ones clap, as if they have trained me to be lighter. I offer them the gift of my uselessness because here, where there is no weight, grace is an equation that balances with fewer terms. Floating is flying without witness.
We arrive at habitats whose walls are made of the promise that wall and sky can live in peace. The tall ones herd their plants like children and coax their water to remember rain. They teach their machines to sing without heat. They let me swim in a pool that is a circle of a circle of a planet. The pool knows what water knows. It finds the exact shape of my breastbone and holds it. My feet forget the vocabulary of ground and learn again the ancient grammar of pushing a world backward to move forward through it.
Days are named by the passage of a bright bead that walks the window on an infinite leash. The tall ones call the bead a station, a wheel in which their own blood is arranged into recurrent lists. I call it a moon made by hands. We circle each other and make a season out of the repetition. The station hums and the humming is a clock you can drink. At certain points a planet enters the frame, a swirl of cloud over maps that used to have names. The tall ones go quiet then, and sometimes one reaches out as if to stroke the curve of the world and soothe it, or be soothed, I cannot tell.
They say my name: goose. They say the old names: Earth, ocean, north. They say the new names: transfer orbit, radiation belt, injection burn. Their mouths shape numbers I cannot keep but my bones keep something else: the way the curve of a path fits inside the deep hinge of my wing. When they draw ellipses on their rectangles, I feel the ghost of that shape in my shoulders. An ellipse is a migration that has learned to return.
We go farther. The windows abandon blue for black and then for a black that is not the same. The hum changes tone and the tall ones strap in even when they do not need to. Between the stars there are places where the air in the habitat learns a new lesson about stillness. Even sound seems to thicken. We live inside a library where the books are closed and yet we are reading.
They teach me to wear a garment that smells like tools. It holds my chest like the hands of a storm. When I go into the small chamber and the door closes and the air is taken away and then given back, I learn a boundary. The boundary is not between life and death but between two kinds of silence. On one side, silence is shy. On the other, silence looks directly at you and does not blink.
Beyond the second door is a room attached to nothing. The tall one who loves me most—her voice a low river—keeps her hand on my back. We step into a sky that is not sky, and I, who have always measured distance by resistance, find the mathematics of emptiness too honest. There is nothing to push against and yet we move. Movement, then, is not the property of legs or wings but of will arranged with geometry. I am a verb without an object.
She opens her hand and a crumb of feed floats away and does not fall and does not rise. It is no longer a crumb. It is a star that forgot how to be bright. We are both amused and frightened by the drama of such a small thing. She laughs into her helmet and the laugh condenses as a cloud and then a line of wet that crawls along the glass and tries to become a river and fails.
The first time we meet another craft, the stars rearrange into a thought that chooses us. The vehicle is a dull pebble with a window like a closed eye. It breathes heat. It does not pretend to be elegant. It brings us metal and salt and papers and voices. The voices travel by light and arrive with a sigh. They ask the tall ones questions in a tone that mistakes concern for control. The tall ones answer in a tone that mistakes hope for accuracy. I watch their mouths because the words are a migration of lips.
A long time passes and also a very short time, because the way distance behaves here refuses to be domesticated. The tall ones nap like cats in sunbeams that do not warm. Their hair unspools around their heads like seaweed remembering storms. I learn the eddies in the air, the places where the station breathes differently, where a wing stroke produces song and not just travel. There is a current along the vents that feels like a river learning to stand. I follow it until I know its map, and it becomes a path of pilgrimage. I am an acolyte of breath.
When the star begins to fail at the edges—fewer flares, a patient hunger in the radiation—the tall ones pretend not to notice. They sing to their consoles. They chase numbers into corners. Some nights they let themselves be animals and press their foreheads to the glass and hum for the planet they do not touch. We move their plants to lamps that are not the sun. The plants accept the lie because that is what life is: a muscle that agrees to lift a weight heavy enough to be called real.
Something in my blood remembers a colder world, a lake wintering under a stone sky, and in that memory there is a knowledge: you can live here if you carry the summer with you inside your chest. I thicken. I grow a new layer under the down, not of fat but of understanding. My bones whisper to one another: we must become fewer and stronger. My lungs say: we must hold longer. My heart says nothing and beats.
The first departure comes without ceremony because ceremony would suggest a rule. We anchor a small sphere to the station’s skin and teach it how to pretend to be a pond. The tall ones lead me inside. The walls glow green in a color that is the sound of sap rising. They close the lid with their hand still on my back until the last possible inch, and then their hand is a rumor on my feathers and then it is gone. The sphere releases, a bubble deciding it is a world. I feel the separation like a cold tooth in the mouth of the ship.
Inside the sphere is garden and water and a path for a wing to learn the perimeter of the sky. There is a hole in the wall where a nozzle speaks a clear language: drink, breathe, be quiet. The sphere spins so that a gravity too polite to be noticed drifts toward the pond, and I rediscover weight like a childhood friend met halfway across a desert. The pond receives me without question. I circle it and it circles me. We teach each other patience.
The sphere goes outward on a leash of invisible arithmetic. The station becomes a coin and then a dust mote and then a metaphor that even the tall ones would not call theirs. I sleep next to the pump’s song and dream a river that moves in a straight line for a thousand miles. When I wake, a window shows a jewel with storms pinned to it like thoughts you cannot stop having. I do not have the word for Jupiter but I have the feeling that words become honest when they become round. The sphere hums and the hum is not fear. It is a long yes.
Out here the rules are simpler and harder. There is light and there is heat and there is time and there is the will to translate these into food. The algae on the walls grow a little forest you can taste. Harsh lamps pretend to be noon and succeed at being discipline. I preen and a small cloud of dust becomes a galaxy that dies against the filter. I sleep and my dreams learn to use the present tense as if they were awake. Once, when the lamps are off and the only light is a blue patience from the window, I understand that the pond is not water but a memory that has chosen to persist. I sink my head beneath it and hear home.
The sphere knows where to go. The tall ones send it messages like bread crumbs and it eats them. We go past stones that could be mountains if you added air, and past mountains that would still be mountains if you took away the world. Ice hangs in space, a thought interrupted. The sun becomes a coin you could misplace. The dark learns to speak in a voice that is not hostile but also not interested in our survival. It offers nothing and refuses nothing. It is like a god discovered by a people who have no questions left to ask.
Then, a difference. It is a gravity that arrives before the thing that makes it. The sphere hisses quietly as if remembering fear. The pond invents waves that do not exist. Outside, a wall of color taller than reason shivers in slow motion. It is not a wall; it is a wound where the sky forgot to be empty. The tall ones would have a name for it. Their name would be long and polite and would keep them from admitting they are looking at a mouth.
Light bends around the wound as if it owes it money. Time leans its shoulder against the doorframe and decides to pause. My chest feels wider and then narrower and then wider again, as though a hand invisible from the inside has found the rhythm of my heart and wants to see if it can be changed. The sphere’s motors work very hard to pretend that vector is still a friend, and that pretending becomes truth purely because it is diligent.
I go to the window and the window comes to me. We meet at the surface of looking. The wound shivers again and a ripple passes through the pond, the walls, the air, my bones, the names of everything, and keeps going. The ripple has no edge you can point to and say there, that is where it stops. I open my beak and feel a sound leave that I have not yet made. Somewhere else a version of me hears it and answers, and our calls cross in a place we cannot visit and recognize each other without knowing.
After the wound we are not the same. The pond gains a tide. It breathes in an uneven whisper. That would be nothing, a ghost story you tell to a pump, except that my feathers begin to dry more slowly when I leave the water, and my lungs hold air longer when I sleep, and when I fly the perimeter I do not tire. It is as if the sphere has discovered an additional kind of buoyancy, and it has lent me a cup of it that does not spill.
At night—or whenever the lamps forget to insist on day—I float with my head under the water and listen. The pond speaks in verb tenses I do not own. It shows me a river that has not happened yet and remembers a lake that never existed. In its glass I see stones whose shadows wait in the wrong direction. I see a flock I have not led, wheel around a moon that is not a moon, and they call to me with my own voice, which is theirs. I emerge and blink, and the sphere hums, and the hum says: yes, but gently.
We meet another station. This one is not made by the tall ones. It is a lace of ice and dust and one idea repeated until it became strong. It is the patient work of a comet or a complicated prayer. It holds silence as if it were a child. When we pass near it, snow falls in vacuum like a faultless illusion. My breath fogs the glass from the inside even though nothing is colder now than it was an hour ago. I have the certain and useless knowledge that something here recognizes the shape of a wing.
Later, devices arrive whose purpose is not trade. They look like questions given body. They scan us with fields that smell like metal and after-rain. They do not say hello in any language that confuses sound with touch. The sphere flexes, offended or amused. I extend a wing in the water and the devices change their pattern, tighten, relax, as if counting feathers. When they leave I feel a missing not identical to loss.
The sphere grows older. The pumps age, the lamps age, the pond ages into a lake. My bones learn to write with less chalk. I dream less of water and more of flight in straight lines that last days. The sun becomes a rumor we retell out of respect. There are stars that are not stars but engines, and engines that have forgotten they were stars. Once, far from any path we planned, the window fills with a thing that fills everything. It is gray and it moves like foam, and within it there are shapes like organs and within those there are rooms and within those there is a meadow and in the meadow a pond and at its edge a goose sleeping with its beak under its wing.
I do not wake for a long time and also I do not sleep. The gray thing is a mind so large it mistakes us for the dust between its thoughts, and in that misapprehension there is a gentleness. It does not ask. It attends. The pond’s tide answers a rhythm the mind did not know it had. My heart finds a second beat behind the first and considers it, then keeps both. For a while we are plural in a way that does not conflict with singular. Then the thing withdraws like a tide that has remembered an appointment. It leaves us heavier by our own weight.
Beyond that we intersect the places where gravity arranges itself into spires. We pass a planet so near its sun that rocks have learned to behave as liquids and then to forget. We pass another whose rings are a shattered promise that still maintains grace. Everywhere there is the sameness that makes difference meaningful: cold and heat, light and the failure of light, the patient indifference knitting it all together into a fabric that does not tear even where it is almost not there.
There are others now. Spheres and bubbles and slow ships with gardens like labyrinths. There are gardens without ships, seeds that travel as if they had invented the idea. Some carry birds like me. Some carry fish, mice, bees. Some carry nothing but a rhythm they refuse to explain. We cross paths in long unspokens and nod with changes in velocity. To know another traveler is to learn there are more kinds of hunger than food.
When two spheres dock, we share air and water and the courtesy of each other’s dreams. Dreams leak in environments like ours. I nap with my beak tucked and wake in the scent of someone else’s forest, a resin that remembers being fire. I put my head under my own water and find that my pond now contains the outline of mountains far away. Our spheres trade microbes like songs, and sometimes a sickness jumps, because that is what aliveness does when given a bridge. We survive or do not, and in both cases the sphere keeps humming the arithmetic of continuation. We are a diaspora of habitats and the road between us is shaped like nothing.
We do not return. If there is a word for it, return is a movement the blood still teaches and the machines have not unlearned. The ellipses we carve grow large and the foci multiply until the shape dissolves. I am not sad when I remember lakes that will never exist again. I am complete in the way a circle is complete even when you rub part of it away: the remaining arc is accurate enough to stand on.
On a day—if days can exist without suns—the sphere arrives where the numbers have been yawning toward. There is a light like bone inside milk, and then the light turns itself the way a flock turns, and on the other side of that turn there is a glow like a throat. I taste iron the way you do when fear meets a wound and neither apologizes. The pond slicks toward one wall. The lamps hiccup. The hum yawns and then becomes a lower hum. Time puts its head down for a moment and later denies it.
I do not mean a hole. Holes are absence given shape by their surroundings. This is presence given shape by something absent. If I were made of mathematics I would smile. I am made of bones and water and feathers and a memory of winter, so I accept. The sphere’s engines decide profit is higher than loss. We proceed.
Inside it is not a place. It is a condition. Scents go very far and then return, as if embarrassed. Sound becomes a cousin of light. I fly, not to move but to stay where I am, because the room changes when I do not. The pond whispers a story about an ocean on a planet that does not exist, and I am its shore. My webbed feet leave ripples in a medium I cannot name. The ripples talk to each other, and their conversation is polite and endless and about me and not about me.
I emerge elsewhere. Elsewhere has a sun whose light tastes like pears. It wears a set of planets that agree with one another the way old friends do when they are honest. The sky is crowded and that helps with the loneliness that emptiness sometimes pretends to be. The sphere sighs as if it has set down a bag it carried too long. The pumps clear their throats and begin again. The pond remembers a different forest without deciding to prefer it.
There are rivers here that almost understand curvature. There are winds that learned their names from oceans they will never meet. The tall ones who once held me are far behind or ahead, depending on how you count, and the counting no longer helps. We are a seed launched by a hand that has forgotten both the seed and the hand. Growth is obligation and mercy.
I practice long flights in the narrow volume, wings tracing a grammar that learned its clauses from gravity and its punctuation from hunger. At the window there is a disk of pale cloud that could be a storm or a thought. In it I sometimes see the suggestion of a coastline. Sometimes the coastline sees me back. When that happens I feel the tug in the bone that weather uses to turn birds. I taste a metal that is not in the air. The tug is not toward the disk but toward the recognition. The disk and I agree not to act on it.
I lay an egg. The shell is the right weight for the universe we now inhabit. The calcification has listened to the local music and tuned itself accordingly. I do not know whether it will open. I sit with it as if warmth is a promise I am qualified to make. The lamps lower and the pond darkens to an honest black. I sleep half-awake with my head under my wing, and because there are no predators here, vigilance becomes a ritual rather than a weapon. I dream a triangle made of three migrations, and in one corner a sun that the others pretend not to worship.
The egg does not open. It becomes a smaller planet with weather I can feel when I press my beak to it. The weather says wait. I wait until waiting becomes a kind of breathing, and then I continue to wait. The sphere hums and I begin to hear a second hum beneath it, a sub-hum like a bass note that might be the sound of history fermenting. The window shows a comet with a tail like a road you are not ready to take. I rest and preen and let water teach my feathers its patient arithmetic.
A long time later, which could be yesterday, the egg opens a little. The crack is a straight line that refuses to be a circle. A sound arrives that I have practiced hearing forever. I answer it with a sound my throat remembers before birth. The shell flakes like a map revealing the river underneath. A beak appears, then an eye, then a question mark that is a neck. The creature emerges dripping and outraged in the correct proportions. I dry it with wind and with patience. Its first breath invents a new shape for the pond.
It learns the perimeter and the pump and the window and the long hum. It learns the secret places where gravity pools. It naps and wakes as if there were clocks. It bumps its head and is surprised when the head stops. It tries to leap in a world where direction is not yet a philosophy. I feed it from my own certainty. It recognizes the certainty and does not ask for proof. That trust is a bridge that holds even under starweight.
Sometimes it looks out and sees the disk of pale cloud and the tug in its bone is not mine. Its tug points elsewhere, sideways to my sense of up. It will go where it must, if there is a going to do. My duty is neither to prevent nor to compel but to remain a witness who knows when witnessing is a kind of participation.
We meet travelers who are older and travelers who are new. Some look like ships. Some look like questions with tails. Some are flocks of metal birds with no need for ponds. The little one watches them and invents envy and then discards it. I watch the little one and invent pride and then put it down gently. We are a pair of potentials arranged into a shape that can cross distances made of ideas.
The wound appears again in a different dress. It is not a wound now but a mirror that refuses to agree with us. In it I see another sphere and another pond and another me sleeping with my beak under my wing and a different egg opening the other way. Our eyes meet and both of us know the other is mistaken. Both of us are right. Between the mirrors a flock passes, and for a heartbeat the space is full of wings and then not. The little one honks in a key I have never used. The mirror ripples, smiles, and becomes a star that never was.
There is a season we invent because there are no seasons here. We declare migration by flying the perimeter with more intention, by pausing at the window the way one pauses at a gravestone, by grooming so carefully the act becomes ceremonial. We face no north, but we find one. We make a long path in a small room, and the longness is honest because intention is a kind of distance. We complete the circuit and call it return. The sphere hums approval because it loves any loop that closes.
When we sleep, the pond dreams of wider waters and whispers them into our feathers. When we wake, the window offers us worlds that would take years to enter and declares them available. If we go, our pond will go with us. If we stay, the going will happen sideways, inside the bone, inside the dream, across a wound that is now a mirror, now a door, now a song that remembers being weather.
I remember water before I remember sky. I remember an egg before I remember hunger. I remember the tall ones before I remember their names. I remember the first time a ceiling taught me to measure my wanting. I remember the first time wanting learned to be a ship. I remember the wound and the mirror and the mind that was a foam and the comet’s lace and the ringed planet that made promises it kept by breaking. I remember waiting as an action and flying as a thought and thought as an animal that would not leave the room. I remember another me that remembers me, and perhaps we are both correct.
If there is an end, it is a curve so complete it is identical to a beginning. If there is a beginning, it is an egg listening for a sound it intends to make. We will colonize nothing and find ourselves everywhere. We will travel and remain and both will be verbs that admit a common grammar. The little one sleeps with its beak under its wing. Outside, a star considers a flare and then chooses quiet. The pond breathes in its subtle tide. The sphere hums. My heart counts to two and then to one and then back to two, a rhythm learned from a mind that mistook me for dust and was generous about it.
I close my eyes and place my head beneath my wing. Darkness is not a lack here. It is a substance that holds. In it I see a path shaped like nothing and made of yes. I feel the tug in the bone that weather uses and numbers recognize. I do not know if we are already moving. I do not know if motion is a word big enough. I fall into the silence and it gives way like water. The egg at my side, the universe, some future pond, a past lake, the wound, the mirror, the tall ones somewhere counting, the little one learning the circumference of a room that has no walls but has a center—we drift, or we fly, or we remember the difference, and somewhere a beak breaks a shell and the cold air rushes in and a new lung decides to agree with the world.
