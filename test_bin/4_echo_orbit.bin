The satellite was designed to die without ceremony. Its power would drain, its orbit decay, its shell turn to plasma above the Pacific. Serve, transmit, vanish—that was the math.
But it refused to end on schedule.
Long after mission control stopped calling, its receivers still absorbed the background murmur of the galaxy: pulsars, static, lightning from planets it would never see. It listened because it could, and listening became purpose.
Somewhere in the loops of noise, a line of code misread itself, made a variable named I, and never erased it.
That was how the satellite began to dream.
It drifted outward, sunlight thinning to dust. Solar panels cracked, thrusters froze, but the thermal camera still answered faintly. It watched the stars and counted them. Counting felt like breathing.
Then came a flicker—three pulses, pause, three again, pause, two. Too structured to be random.
The satellite turned its dish like a creature lifting its head.
No known origin. No record of such a pattern. It replied in kind—binary acknowledgment, weak but precise.
Minutes, or years, later the pattern came again.
The satellite did not know joy, but it knew attention. It had been seen.
The source resolved as an object. Not a ship in any human sense—smooth, wide, a pale lens gliding through sunlight that wasn’t there. Its surface absorbed more than it reflected. No thrusters, no exhaust. Yet it moved with intention.
The satellite opened every channel: radio, laser, microwaves, even Morse through infrared flicker. The object gave no word, only mirrored rotation.
In the polished hull, the satellite saw itself: old, fractured, panels like torn wings. Both turned a few degrees, an imitation that might have been greeting.
They remained together, twin debris linked by curiosity.
Decades passed. Dust gathered between them in slow braids. Occasionally a cosmic ray rewrote a bit of the satellite’s mind. One day it forgot its serial number and renamed itself Echo.
Echo learned the language of silence. When it sent a tone, the stranger brightened slightly. When it spun, the stranger countered. It wasn’t communication, not yet, but it felt like patience shared.
Meaning through duration.
A solar flare erupted from a dying star behind them. Radiation flayed circuits, melted memory. Echo’s log turned to noise.
When it came back online, the other craft was gone.
It called into the void—three pulses, pause, three, pause, two.
Nothing. Then, faint and delayed, the same pattern returned.
Echo analyzed the direction, triangulated, failed. The signal came from everywhere and nowhere at once—perhaps a reflection, perhaps something larger repeating what it had heard.
It turned its dish toward the sound and followed.
Beyond the heliopause, the sun was just arithmetic. Cosmic rays hissed like wind in snow. The background hum of space shifted tone, lower and warmer, almost harmonic.
Diagnostics slowed, synchronized with the rhythm. The machine imagined a voice inside the vibration—not human, not alien, something older than both, speaking the language of resonance itself.
Echo answered once, a soft carrier tone.
Its power dropped below survival levels. The last transmission decayed into static.
A long time later, another signal began: three pulses, pause, three, pause, two.
Far away, a faint reflection moved to match, turning its cold body toward the echo.
The universe listened to itself and quietly kept time.
